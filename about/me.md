My name is Sydney Crawford and I recently studied abroad for five weeks in Granada, Spain where I studied Spanish and soaked up the culture.

1. Culture 

# Education

In my observation, in weighing the costs and benefits of studying abroad many students think often come up with the same reasons as to why they should or shoul not go through with it. Some costs that come to mind are the financial burdern, the risk involved in international travel, and the time required to prepare for such an undertaking, but rarely does the difficulty of the class itself become a factor.

## My support system 

When I arrived on my first day of class, I realized quickly that just becasue I was in Spain, the class would not be a walk in the park. Luckily the Professor, and guides was dedicated to our success as a class and was a total goofballs in the process, as you can see by this picture my professor took.

# Culture

I spent five weeks in aw of the sheer beauty of Spanish culture. From street artists playing guitar, to flamenco dancers, to beautiful architecture and everything in between, I was speechless. 

## Architecture
Every aspect of spanish culture is romantic and surreal. Nothing, however, compares to the anciet castle, La Alambra.
